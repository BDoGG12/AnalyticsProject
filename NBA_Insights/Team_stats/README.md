The main goal is to model the relationship between team points and percentages for field goals, free throws, and three point shots. In addition, offensive rebounds, total team rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, and total fouls will be included in the model. Therefore, the supervised learning method will be implemented using linear & logistic regression.

The Oklahoma City Thunder will be the sample team of this analysis.
