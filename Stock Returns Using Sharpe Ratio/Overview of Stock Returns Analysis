DataCamp Project: Calculating the returns on stock investments using the Sharpe ratio.

The main purpose of this project is to decide which of the two stocks would be an great investment. Using the Sharpe Ratio will give enough information for Amazon and Facebook. We are given two separate datasets containing the historical stock prices and stock market indexes of Fortune 500 companies in the year of 2016. We will be calculating daily returns, excess returns, standard deviation, and average excess returns on stocks. The standard deviation is also known as the risk factor for the stocks.
